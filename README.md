# Program-scripts-repository

This is a script repository for random projects or ideas I have completed or I am working on.
Some of these projects are from the Google "Automation with Python" course on Coursera.
Other projects are ideas that I found from searching the internet.
The original commits for my "File-download-rename-upload" project are located in this repository, but the project
has since been moved to a seperate repository.
